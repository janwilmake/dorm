# DORM Transactions

ðŸ’¡ How transactions can be used: https://letmeprompt.com/httpsdevelopersc-vx7x1c0. Making a remote transaction possible would be very useful https://letmeprompt.com/httpsdevelopersc-3mptgo0. We MAY now be able to create a multi-DO transaction in DORM. See https://x.com/janwilmake/status/1926928095329587450 for potential feeback.

Also, the question of sending multiple queries to the DO is not answered, making things slow and potentially not ACID. especially when working with many DBs, allowing point-in-time recovery and transactions would be huge.
